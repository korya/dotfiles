.bash.d/ hierarchy
------------------

(*) .bash.d/init/

The directory .bash.d/init contains init scripts for bash.
All the scripts under mask S<3-digit NUM>-*.sh in this directory are loaded
automatically from .bashrc in a lexicographical order.
The scripts whose <3-digit NUM> is less than 100 are loaded for both interactive and
non-interactive shells. While the scripts with <3-digit NUM> greater or equal
to 100 are loaded for interactive shell only.

(*) .bash.d/lib/

The directory .bash.d/lib contains bash libraries.
A library can be either a set of utility functions, which are shared and used
by multiple scripts or other libraries, or a well-defined ADT (like hash).
Library API:
- Initialization:
     Just include the .bash.d/lib/lib file
- Inclusion:
     Use `lib_include' function defined in .bash.d/lib/lib.
     This function ensures that each library is included just once.

How to use
----------

Just move your script to .bash.d/init/ and rename it appropriately. Alternative
way is to create a link in .bash.d/init/ to your script. Thus it will
be loaded automatically for all next bash sessions.
